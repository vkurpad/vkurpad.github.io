I'm Vinod Kurpad, I very often find myself in a situation where I built a little prototype and thought it would be great to share, but have never followed through on it. This is my attempt to blog about some of the intersting things I'm working on and hopefully catch your interest:

- Currently I'm spending a lot of my time on NLP and content understanding
- Interested in applying AI to things I'm passionate about, like coaching tennis

What else do you need?

### my history

Lets start here and write the chapter moving forward
